## TODO
In order of importance (mostly)

- [ ] Display live feeds
- [x] Edit pMotion `settings.conf.php`
- [ ] Edit `motion.conf` (in progress)
- [ ] Edit `camera#.conf` (in progress`)
- [ ] Manage historical footage / stills
- [ ] `daemon` style monitor (runs in background without needing page open)
- [ ] Neptune
- [ ] Beautification / styling
- [x] Theme support (limited to just changing which stylesheet is used)
- [ ] Multi-Language support
- [ ] Generating mask files (very low priority)

## WontDo (anytime soon)

- [x] Passthru recording (limitation of Motion)
- [x] Audio of any sort (limitation of Motion)
- [x] Multi-User support (possibly revisit later but outside the initial scope of the project)
- [x] `cloud` style `solution` (KISS)
