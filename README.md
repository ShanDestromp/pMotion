# pMotion
pMotion is a PHP based frontend to [Motion-Project](https://github.com/Motion-Project/motion).

The goal is to have full control over Motion; while also having a reasonable interface with live feeds and playback of recordings in a lightweight package.

pMotion only requires a PHP capable webserver with read/write access to wherever you store your footage; and Motion installed.  No bulky SQL databases or inconvenient dependencies.

# Current Status

Basic functionality is the priority at the moment - reading existing camera configurations, historical playback, and management of recordings.
